# Code and mapping examples

This repo contains mapping examples and notebooks for processing and analyzing satellite images and running network analysis using a list of libraries: spfeas, mpglue, osmnx, and networkx. 

This repo contains three folders:

1. Data_visualization - mapping samples about disaster shelters' accessibility to nearby hospitals in Haiti. The maps were geneated using ArcGIS.

2. Imagery_analysis - example notebook for satelitte image processing and landcover classification using mpglue. There is also an example for using spfeas to conduct image processing in terminal.

3. Network_anlaysis - example notebook for analyzing Haitian hospitals' criticality to nearby communities. Additional travel distance when each hospital is removed is calculated and weighted by community population.
